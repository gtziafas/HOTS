HOTS in an on-going effort to collect an RGB-D dataset aimed for benchmarking visual and 3D recognition, sim-to-real domain adaptation (and more) in robotics-related domains. It contains a broad range of typical household objects annotated in multiple levels of granularity for class labels (supercategory, category and instance), as well as visual attribute annotations (color, material etc.) and pair-wise spatial relations in the scene-level (scene graphs). The current version of the dataset contains only single view RGB-D data captured from an ASUS Xtion sensor mounted on a real-robot setup.
